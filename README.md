# AirBnB_Data_Analysis_Toronto

Welcome to Toronto Airbnb Analysis Project! In this project, I took the City of Toronto summarized dataset to take some insights from the data (exploratory analysis) and evetually answer the questions with statistics.

If you are interested in the more concise version of the project, please visit my Medium article: https://brucmendes.medium.com/

I used Python to do the data preprocessing, analysis and visualization. 

Please let me know if something isn't clear or you have some thought on this project.
